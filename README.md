# Azure Infra Handbook: An Architectural Journey 📘

This digital space is the central hub for my learning journey and technical expertise in the Azure infrastructure world.

As a **Digital Cloud Solution Architect**, I bring together everything I learn—from cloud fundamentals (AZ-900) to complex infrastructure designs. For me, this is not just documentation; it is a "living notebook" where I organize architectural challenges, solutions, and technical details.

## 🚀 Why This Handbook?

My main motivation for creating this handbook is to make complex Azure services (like Networking, Compute, and Security) easier to understand. From "catching your first fish to managing a whole fleet," I share every step and every scenario I learn in the Azure ecosystem.

## 🛠️ How to Use It?

I have organized my notes to be practical and strategic from an architect's perspective:

* **Systematic Progress:** You can start from basic concepts and move toward deep technical topics using the menu on the left.
* **Quick Access:** The search bar at the top will be your best friend when you are looking for a specific topic or service.
* **Bilingual Structure:** I design my notes in both Turkish and English to meet global standards; you can change the language at the top right.

These notes will continue to update and grow as I learn and work on new projects. Let's dive into the Azure infrastructure ocean!
